# Veterinarian Website
Theme code of the Wordpress/Elementor website for a veterinary clinic

## Development
This website was created for a veterinarian clinic in Remshalden, Germany.<br>
They wanted a simple but clearly structured website so that their customers could get all the important information about the clinic.<br>

The website was created with WordPress in combination with Elementor. For the construction of the website, partly custom widgets were programmed in PHP, partly already existing widgets were used. <br>

This website was entirely designed and developed by me. <br>

## Used Technology
Programming Languages: PHP/JS/HTML/SCSS  <br />
Content Management System: Wordpress v6.1.1<br />
Plugins: Elementor v3.10.0, Real Cookie Banner v3.4.11

## Website-URL
https://tierarztpraxis-remshalden.de/
